# Introduction-to-Data-Structures
This repository contains the Data Structure projects that go through fundamentals in organizing data. 
The files in this repository contain fundamental techniques like recursion and method calls.
There are some files in between that contain Graphics content through Java FX and animation.  
Later, in the projects, the development goes deep into Linked Lists, Binary Search Trees, 
and Stacks where the algorithms get complex.
